## DIVIDE-GAME


This is a simple but interesting game.

## Rules of the game

In this game, there is a 3x3 grid which is empty initially.
Below that there are 3 numbers in a sequence. You can only drag the rightmost one.
If you place the number adjacent to any number in the grid, and if one is divisible by
the other , then the smaller among them vanishes and the larger one becomes the quotient.

For example, If the two numbers are 6 and 12, then 6 vanishes and 12 becomes 2.

The score gets updated as the game progresses. 

When the grid is filled and no number can be reduced , the game gets over.

Also, there is a blank box in the bottom where you can keep the number from the sequence for some time and drag it to the grid whenever you want.
